Jack really likes his number five: the trick here is that you have to multiply each number by 5 raised to the number of digits of each numbers,
so, for example:

multiply(3)==15
multiply(10)==250
multiply(200)==25000

solution:

function multiply(number){
 let len = String(Math.abs(number)).length;
   for (let i = 0; i < len; i++){
    number *=5;
  }
  return number;
}
