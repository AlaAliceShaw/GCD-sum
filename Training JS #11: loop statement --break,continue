In this example, console.log(arr[i]) is never executed for negative element. thanks to continue.
Through the use of break and continue, you can make the loop statement more flexible and convenient.
let's us do some task with break and continue.

solution:
function grabDoll(dolls){
  var bag=[];
  for(let i = 0; i < dolls.length; i++){
    if(dolls[i] === "Hello Kitty" || dolls[i] ==="Barbie doll"){
      bag.push(dolls[i]);
    } else continue;
    if(bag.length === 3) break;
  }
  return bag;
}
