You must implement a function that return the difference between the biggest and the smallest value in a list(lst) received as parameter.
The list(lst) contains integers, that means it may contain some negative numbers.
If the list is empty or contains a single element, return 0.

solution 1:

function maxDiff(list) {
 if(!list.length) return 0;
  return Math.max(...list) - Math.min(...list);
  
  solution 2:
  
  function maxDiff(list) {
  return list.length > 1 ? Math.max(...list) - Math.min(...list) : 0
}
