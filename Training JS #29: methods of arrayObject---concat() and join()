This lesson we learn two methods of array: concat() and join(). 
We have seen concat() in the stringObject method, but the method of the arrayObject is different from the stringObject method,
so we need to learn again. When studying the stringObject method split(), we have simply learned the join() method. 
This time we will review and explain it in detail.
Their definitions and syntax please refer to:
Array.prototype.concat()
Array.prototype.join()
(Please forgive me for my laziness;-)
Here are some examples to help us understand the use of concat() and join():
We first learn the concat() method, which can add some elements to the end of the array. concat() can have more and more parameters,
and the parameter can be values, array or otherthings. Look this example:


solution 1:

function bigToSmall(arr){
 let result=[].concat(...arr).sort((a,b) => b - a).join('>');
  return result;
}


solution 2: (use loops)

function bigToSmall(arr){
 let array = [];
   for (let i = 0; i <arr.length; i++) {
     for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
     array.push(arr[i][j])
     }
   }

   array = array.sort((a,b) => b-a).join('>')
   return array;
}
