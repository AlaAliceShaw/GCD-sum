Oh no!
Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!
you need to cast the whole array to the correct type.
Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.
ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]


solution 1:

function toNumberArray(stringarray){
  return stringarray.map(Number);
}

solution 2:  loop

function toNumberArray(stringarray){
  let arr = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < stringarray.length; i++){
    arr.push(+stringarray[i]);
  }
  return arr;
}
