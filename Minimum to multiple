Given two integers a and x, return the minimum non-negative number to add to / subtract from a to make it a multiple of x.
minimum(10, 6)  //= 2
10+2 = 12 which is a multiple of 6



solution:

function minimum(a, x) {
   let result1 = 0
   let result2 = 0;
   for (let i = 0; i < x; i++)
      if((a - i) % x === 0 || (a + i) % x === 0)
      return i;
}
