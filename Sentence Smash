Sentence Smash
Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence.
You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!
Example
['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'he

solution 1:

function smash (words) {
  return words.join(' ');
}

solution 2  (loop)

function smash (words) {
 let result = '';
  for(let i = 0;i < words.length; i++){
    if(i == 0){
      result = result + words[i]
    }else{
      result = result + ' ' + words[i]
    }
  }
    return result;
}
