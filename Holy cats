My granny has several cats. Most of them are wicked, some are normal and some of them are the likes of ^(~_~)^ aka holy cats. 
So my granny asked me to separate the holy cats from the rest of the crew. But I don't know how to do it. 
Can you help me separate the holy cats from the rest? In case there are no holy cats in the group,
return an empty array.

solution 1:

function holycats(input){
    return input.filter(el=>el!='wicked').filter(el=>el!='normal');
}


solution 2:

function holycats(input){
  let arr = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++){
    if (input[i] !== 'wicked' && input[i] !== 'normal')
      arr.push(input[i]);
    }
  return arr;
}
