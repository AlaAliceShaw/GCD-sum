A sequence or a series, in mathematics, is a string of objects, like numbers, that follow a particular pattern. 
The individual elements in a sequence are called terms. A simple example is 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, ..., where the pattern is:
"add 3 to the previous term".
In this kata, we will be using a more complicated sequence: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ... 
This sequence is generated with the pattern: "the nth term is the sum of numbers from 0 to n, inclusive".
[ 0,  1,    3,      6,   

solution:

function sumOfN(n) {
  let array = [];
  array[0] = 0;
  for (var i = 1; i < Math.abs(n)+1; i++) {
    if (n > 0) array[i] = array[i-1]+i;
    else array[i] = array[i-1]-i;
  }
  return array;
}
