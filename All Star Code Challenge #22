Create a function called toTime() that takes an integer argument of seconds and converts
the value into a string describing how many hours and minutes comprise that many seconds.
Any remaining seconds left over are ignored.
Note:
The string output needs to be in the specific form - "X hour(s) and X minute(s)"
solution:



function toTime(seconds) {
    let hour = Math.floor(seconds / 3600);
    let minute = Math.floor((seconds - (hour * 3600)) / 60);

    return `${hour} hour(s) and ${minute} minute(s)`;
}
