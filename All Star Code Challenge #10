This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students
Create a function named fibonacci() that takes a number argument, N, and gets the Nth number in a fibonacci sequence.
The fibonacci sequence is created by adding the previous 2 numbers together to form the next number
in the sequence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...

solution:
function  fibonacci(n){
  if(n==0) return 0;
    if(n == 1) return 1;
        let num1 = 0;
        let  num2 = 1;
        let sum;
        let i = 1;
          while (i<n){
            sum = num1 + num2;
            num1 = num2;
            num2 = sum;
            i+=1;
         }
        return num2;
}
