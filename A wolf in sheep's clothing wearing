A wolf in sheep's clothing
Wolves have been reintroduced to Great Britain. You are a sheep farmer, and are now plagued by wolves which pretend to be sheep. 
Fortunately, you are good at spotting them.Warn the sheep in front of the wolf that it is about to be eaten. 
Remember that you are standing at the front of the queue which is at the end of the array:
[sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, wolf, sheep, sheep]  If the wolf is the closest animal to you, 
return "Pls go away and stop eating my sheep". 
Otherwise, return "Oi! Sheep number N! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!" where N is the sheep's position in the queue

solution 1: use reverce

function warnTheSheep(queue) {
  const position = queue.reverse().indexOf('wolf');
  return position === 0 ? 'Pls go away and stop eating my sheep' : `Oi! Sheep number ${ position }! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!`;
}

solution 2:  use( x.length - x.indexOf(el) -1

function warnTheSheep(queue) {
  let sheepIndex = queue.length - queue.indexOf('wolf') - 1;
    if (sheepIndex === 0)
    return 'Pls go away and stop eating my sheep';
  return `Oi! Sheep number ${sheepIndex}! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!`;
}


solution 3: use loop


  function warnTheSheep(queue){
  let res ='';
  for (let i = queue.length-1; i >= 0 ; i-- ){
    if (queue[i] === 'wolf' && i === queue.length-1){
       return "Pls go away and stop eating my sheep";
    }else if (queue[i] === 'wolf' && i !== queue.length-1){
       return `Oi! Sheep number ${queue.length-i-1}! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!`;
    }
  }
}
